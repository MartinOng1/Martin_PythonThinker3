## Recap 2: Variables & Mind map
# Use mindmap to think about the number of variables you need for
# the following. Then, create a program that does the following:

# You just had lunch at a sushi restaurant and have to calculate
# the total amount you have spent. Different coloured plates
# costs different as shown below:

# Red = $1
# Blue = $2
# Green = $3

# You have ordered a total of 3 red plates, 5 blue plates,
# and 4 green plates. Calculate and print the total amount you
# have spent:

# red = 1
# blue = 2
# green = 3

# redplates = int(input("How many red plates? "))
# blueplates = int(input("How many blue plates? "))
# greenplates = int(input("How many green plates? "))
print(f"You have spent ${redplates*red + blueplates*blue + greenplates*green}.")

## Recap 3: Debugging Average Score Program
# There is a total of 3 bugs in the following program.
# Identify and fix the bugs:

# score_one = 80
# score_two = 90
# score_three = 75

# total = score_one + score_two + score_three

# average_score = str(total / 3)

# student_name = "Alex"

# print("Average score for " + student_name + " is: " + average_score)

## Recap 4: If..elif..else & Flowchart
# Write a program that asks the user to input a score
# (as an integer) and then assigns a grade based on that score.
# Use the following grading scheme:

# If the score is 75 or higher, the grade is 'A'.
# If the score is between 60 and 74 (inclusive), the grade is 'B'.
# If the score is between 50 and 59 (inclusive), the grade is 'C'.
# Any score below 50 will be graded as 'Fail'.

# score = int(input("Enter your score: "))
# if score >= 75:
#     print("A")
# elif score >= 60:
#     print("B")
# elif score >= 50:
#     print("C")
# else:
#     print("You failed.")
